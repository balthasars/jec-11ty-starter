# Introduction

I am writing a series of posts on building site with 11ty, the static site generator. My personal website is built base on this starter.

So far I've wrote the two posts.


1. Project configuration: [jec.fyi/blog/building-my-static-site-with-11ty](https://jec.fyi/blog/building-my-static-site-with-11ty) - release `0.1.1`
2. Setting up GitHub Actions and Firebase Hosting: [jec.fyi/blog/setting-up-github-actions-and-firebase-hosting](https://jec.fyi/blog/setting-up-github-actions-and-firebase-hosting) - release `0.2.0`
3. Customizing File Structure, URLs and Browsersync: [jec.fyi/blog/customizing-file-structure-and-urls](https://jec.fyi/blog/customizing-file-structure-urls-browsersync) - release `0.3.0`

Each blog post come with a new release. You may run `git checkout [release number]` to see how's the code like and follow through my blog post to build your site.  

Stay tune for updates!
